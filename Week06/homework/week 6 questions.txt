1. What has been your experience learning bash?
It has been great. It's a little bit easier to comprehend and grasp it than Python. I have been watching some YouTube videos on bash scripting to help me learn as well.

2. What would have made the experience with learning it better, if there were problems with it, my instructions, or the assignments?
It would have been helpful to include some more examples, practical uses, and some more tutorials from YouTube as that would have helped me learn more about Bash.

3. Approximately how much time did you spend working on assignments?
I spent about 7-8 hours working on the assignments every week.

4. Are you able to see how the programs used in this class or learning bash would be helpful for your career?
I am able to see how useful the programs are and how learning bash can be helpful for my career.
If you needed to make a script to find certain IP addresses and format it in a readable way instead of trying to manually make rules, it can save you lots of time and frustration.
You never know when you will need to make a script to find something like IP addresses for reports or make firewall rules for linux and windows operating systems instead of making firewall rules by hand.
